#### AVSpeech is a new, large-scale audio-visual dataset comprising speech video clips with no interfering backgruond noises. The segments are 3-10 seconds long, and in each clip the audible sound in the soundtrack belongs to a single speaking person, visible in the video. In total, the dataset contains roughly 4700 hours of video segments, from a total of 290k YouTube videos, spanning a wide variety of people, languages and face poses. For more details on how we created the dataset see our paper.
